# Heartbeat Concurrency Pattern in Go
The Heartbeat Concurrency pattern involves sending periodic heartbeat signals to indicate that a process or worker is still active and functioning properly. It is useful in scenarios where you need to monitor the liveness and health of workers and ensure they are functioning as expected.

## Implementation
In this example, we have implemented the Heartbeat Concurrency pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Heartbeat struct, which represents a heartbeat signal. It contains an ID to identify the heartbeat and an Interval to specify the duration between consecutive heartbeats.
2. We define the Worker struct, which represents a worker that sends and receives heartbeat signals. It contains an ID to identify the worker, a Heartbeat channel to receive heartbeat signals, and a Quit channel to signal the worker to quit.
3. The NewWorker function creates a new worker with the specified ID.
4. The Start method of the Worker is used to start the worker. It listens for heartbeat signals on the Heartbeat channel and sends heartbeat responses after a certain interval. It also listens for the Quit signal to gracefully stop the worker.
5. In the main function, we create multiple workers and start them. Each worker sends and receives heartbeat signals in separate goroutines.
6. We simulate sending heartbeat signals to the workers by spawning goroutines that send periodic heartbeat signals to each worker.
7. Finally, we wait for all workers to finish using a sync.WaitGroup.

Feel free to customize and adapt the code and readme according to your specific requirements and preferences for your Heartbeat Concurrency pattern implementation in Go.
