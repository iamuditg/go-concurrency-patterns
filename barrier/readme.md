# Barrier Concurrency Pattern in Go
The Barrier Concurrency pattern allows synchronizing a group of goroutines, making them wait until all of them have reached a certain point before proceeding. It is useful when you have multiple goroutines that need to synchronize their progress and wait for each other to reach a specific stage of execution.

## Implementation
In this example, we have implemented the Barrier Concurrency pattern in Go. Here's how it works:

1. We define the Barrier struct, which represents a synchronization point for a group of goroutines. It contains a count variable to track the number of goroutines, a wg (WaitGroup) to synchronize the wait, a mu (Mutex) to protect the count variable, and a notify channel to signal when all goroutines have reached the barrier.
2. The NewBarrier function creates a new Barrier with the specified count.
3. The Wait method of the Barrier is used by each goroutine to wait for all other goroutines to reach the barrier. It decreases the count and checks if it has reached zero. If the count is zero, it closes the notify channel to signal all waiting goroutines to proceed.
4. In the main function, we create a Barrier with the desired number of workers (goroutines).
5. We start multiple workers in separate goroutines. Each worker performs its work and then waits at the barrier using the Wait method.
6. Once all workers have reached the barrier, they are released and continue with the next phase of work.
7. Finally, we wait for all workers to complete by calling the Wait method on the barrier.

Usage
To use the Barrier Concurrency pattern in your Go programs:

1. Create a Barrier using the NewBarrier function and specify the number of goroutines that need to synchronize.
2. Start multiple goroutines that perform their individual tasks.
3. Inside each goroutine, call the Wait method on the Barrier to wait for all other goroutines to reach the barrier.
4. Once all goroutines have reached the barrier, they are released, and they can continue with the next phase of work.

The Barrier Concurrency pattern allows you to coordinate and synchronize the progress of multiple goroutines, enabling them to work together in a synchronized manner. It is particularly useful in scenarios where different goroutines need to reach a certain stage of execution before proceeding further.

Feel free to customize and adapt the code and readme according to your specific requirements and preferences for your Barrier Concurrency pattern implementation in Go.
