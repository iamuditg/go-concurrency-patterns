# Context Package Pattern in Go

## Description

The Context Package pattern is a powerful concurrency pattern provided by the Go standard library. It allows you to manage and propagate cancellation signals, deadlines, and values across the execution of a program or a set of goroutines. It is useful when you need to control the lifecycle and behavior of concurrent operations in a structured way.

This implementation demonstrates the use of the Context Package pattern in Go. It includes an example of creating a new context with a timeout and running a long-running task concurrently. The pattern allows you to gracefully handle the completion of the task or the expiration of the timeout.
